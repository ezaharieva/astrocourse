    "# Schrödinger's cat\n",
    "In [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics), Schrödinger's cat is a [thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment) experiment concerning [quantum superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition). In the thought experiment, a hypothetical cat in a closed box may be considered to be simultaneously both alive and dead while it is unobserved, as a result of its fate being linked to a random [subatomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle) event that may or may not occur. This experiment, viewed this way, is described as a [paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox). This thought experiment was devised by physicist [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger) in 1935[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger) in a discussion with [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)[[2]](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-epr/) to illustrate what Schrödinger saw as the problems of the [Copenhagen interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation) of quantum mechanics."

    "> Schrödinger's cat: a cat, a flask of poison, and a [radioactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay) source connected to a [Geiger counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geiger_counter) are placed in a sealed box. As illustrated, the quantum description uses a superposition of an alive cat and one that has died."
