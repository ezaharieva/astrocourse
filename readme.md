# Python Workbook Exercises

Welcome to the Python Workbook exercises! This repository contains step-by-step instructions to guide you through various Python and data science concepts using interactive Jupyter notebooks.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Astropy and FITS Files

This exercise introduces basic operations in Python for handling **FITS** files and astronomical data:
- We will import essential libraries.
- Load data from a FITS file (`hst_results_nd.fits`).
- Perform basic data extraction and visualization of star distributions.
- Explore concepts like **extinction values**, **distance distributions**, and **color-magnitude diagrams** (CMD).

### Exercise 2: Advanced Plotting and Analysis

This second exercise focuses on advanced plotting techniques and data analysis:
- We will work with external datasets.
- Perform data manipulation and visualizations.
- Explore advanced charting techniques like histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
